<h1>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
<h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>
<h3>Style attribute</h3>
<p style="background-color: red; color: black">
    Style attribute allows configuring look
    and feel right on the element. Although it's
    very convenient it is considered bad practice
    and you should avoid using the style attribute
</p>

<h3>Link tag</h3>
<p>
  The best way to apply CSS rules is to declare
  them in a separate CSS file and load it with
  the LINK tag. Always use this method.
</p>

<h3>ID selectors</h3>
<p id="id-selector-1">
  Instead of changing the look and
  feel of all the elements of the
  same name, e.g., P, we can refer
  to a specific element by its ID
</p>

<p id="id-selector-2">
  Here's another paragraph using a
  different ID and a different look
  and feel
</p>

<h3>Class selectors</h3>
<p class="class-selector">
  Instead of using IDs to refer
  to elements, you can use an
  element's CLASS attribute</p>
<h4 class="class-selector">
  This heading has same style as
  paragraph above</h4>

<div class="selector-1">
  <h3>Document structure selectors</h3>
  <div class="selector-2">
    Selectors can be combined to refer elements in
    particular places in the document
    <p class="selector-3">
      This paragraph's red background is referenced as
      <br/>.selector-2 .selector3<br/>
      meaning the descendant of some ancestor.
      <br/>
      <span class="selector-4">Whereas this span is a
     direct child of its parent</span>
      <br/>
      You can combine these relationships to create
      specific styles depending on the document
      structure
